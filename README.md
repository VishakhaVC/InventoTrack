InventoTrack – Inventory Management & eCommerce System

InventoTrack is a role-based inventory management and eCommerce web application designed to manage electronic products, stock, orders, and users efficiently. The system is built with three main modules: Admin, Manager, and User, each having specific responsibilities and access levels. The project focuses on maintaining accurate inventory records, smooth order processing, and a user-friendly shopping experience.

The platform allows administrators to control the entire system, including managing admins, managers, users, categories, products, stock, orders, and feedback. Managers handle sales-related operations and reports, while users can register, log in, browse products, add items to the cart, place orders, and manage their profiles. The system also includes features like email-based password recovery, OTP verification, low-stock alerts, and detailed reports.

InventoTrack is developed using PHP and MySQL for the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend, running on an Apache server. It demonstrates real-world implementation of CRUD operations, authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and inventory tracking.

This project is suitable for learning and demonstrating full-stack web development concepts, especially in inventory management and eCommerce workflows.
